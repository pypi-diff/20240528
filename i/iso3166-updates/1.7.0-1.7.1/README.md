 Introduction
 ------------
 `iso3166-updates` is a software and accompanying API that consists of a series of scripts that check for any updates/changes to the ISO 3166 country codes and subdivision naming conventions, as per the ISO 3166 newsletter (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) and Online Browsing Platform (OBP) (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui).
 
-The ISO 3166 standard by the ISO (International Organization for Standardisation) defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, consolidated into the ISO 3166-1 standard [[1]](#references), and their principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces, states, departments, regions), which comprise the ISO 3166-2 standard [[2]](#references). The ISO 3166-1 was first published in 1974 and currently comprises 249 countries, 193 of which are sovereign states that are members of the United Nations ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [[1]](#references). The ISO 3166-2 was first published in 1998 and as of November 2023 there are 5,039 codes defined in it [[2]](#references).

The ISO 3166-1 was first published in 1974 and currently comprises 249 countries, 193 of which are sovereign states that are members of the United Nations ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [[1]](#references). The ISO 3166-2 was first published in 1998 and as of November 2023 there are **5,039** codes defined in it [[2]](#references).
 
 ### Problem Statement:
 
-The ISO is a very dynamic organisation and regularly change/update/remove entries within its library of standards, including the ISO 3166. Additions/changes/deletions to country/territorial codes occur less often in the ISO 3166-1, but changes are more frequent for the ISO 3166-2 codes due to there being thousands more entries, thus it can be difficult to keep up with and track these changes. These changes can occur for a variety of geopolitical and administrative reasons. Previously these changes were communicated via newsletters; but as of July 2013 these changes are now communicated via their online catalogue/Online Browsing Platform (OBP), or via a database, which usually costs money to subscribe to (up to $300) [[3]](#references). Usually these updates are conveyed at the end of the year, with amendments and updates occasionally published at various times throughout the year [[4]](#references).

Usually these updates are conveyed at the end of the year, with amendments and updates occasionally published at various times throughout the year [[4]](#references). 
 
 This software and accompanying API make it extremely easy to check for any new or historic updates to a country or set of country's ISO 3166-2 codes for free; with an easy-to-use interface and Python package and API, ensuring that you get the most up-to-date and accurate ISO 3166-2 codes and naming conventions.
 
 ### Intended Audience:
 
 This software and accompanying API is for anyone working with country data at the ISO 3166 level. It's of high importance that the data you are working with is correct and up-to-date, especially with consistent changes being posted every year since 2000 (excluding 2001 and 2006). Also, it's aimed not just at developers of ISO 3166 applications but for anyone working in that space, hence the creation of an easy-to-use API (https://iso3166-updates.com).

+The main paths/endpoints available in the API are - `/api/all`, `/api/alpha`, `/api/name`, `/api/year` and `/api/months`. 
 
 * `/api/all`: get all of the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for all countries.
 
 * `/api/alpha`: get all the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for one or more countries according to their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, alpha-3 or numeric country codes. A single alpha code or a list of them can be passed to the API e.g. `/api/alpha/AL`, `/api/alpha/BW`, `/api/alpha/FR,DE,HUN,IDN,504`. If an invalid alpha code is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **year** and **month** endpoints to get the country updates for a specific country and year, and the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months, respectively. This will be in the format: `/api/alpha/<input_alpha>/year/<input_year>` and `/api/alpha/<input_alpha>/months/<input_month>`, respectively.
 
-* `/api/name`: get all the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for one or more countries according to their country name, as listed in the ISO 3166-1. A single country name or list of them can be passed into the API e.g. `/api/name/Brazil`, `/api/name/Colombia`, `/api/name/Benin,France,Moldova`. A closeness function is used to get the most approximate available country from the one input, e.g. Sweden will be used if the input is `/api/name/Swede`. If no matching country is found from the closeness function or an invalid name is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **year** and **months** endpoint to get the country updates for a specific country name and year and the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months, respectively. This will be in the format: `/api/name/<input_name>/year/<input_year>` and `/api/name/<input_name>/months/<input_month>`, respectively.

A month range can also be input to get the updates published within a specified range of months, with the start and end month separated by a '-' e.g. `/api/months/12-24`, `/api/months/36-50`. If an invalid month value is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **alpha** and **name** endpoints to get the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months using their ISO 3166-1 alpha code or country name, respectively.

-The API was hosted and built using GCP, with a Cloud Function being used in the backend which is fronted by an api gateway and load balancer. The function calls a GCP Storage bucket to access the back-end JSON where all ISO 3166 updates are stored. <i>Although, due to the cost of infrastructure, the hosting was switched to Vercel (https://vercel.com/).</i>

 Staying up to date
 ------------------
 The list of ISO 3166 updates was last updated on <strong>March 2024</strong>.
 
-The object storing all updates - iso3166-updates.json - for the software package is consistently checked for the latest updates using a Google Cloud Run microservice ([iso3166-check-for-updates](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates/tree/main/iso3166-check-for-updates)). The application is built using a custom Docker container that uses the `iso3166-updates` Python software to pull all the latest updates/changes from the various data sources, to check for the latest updates within a certain period e.g. the past 6-12 months (this month range is used as the ISO usually publishes their updates at the end of the year with occasional mid-year updates). The app compares the generated output with that of the updates JSON currently in the software package and will replace this json to integrate the latest updates found, such that the API will have the most up-to-date data. A Cloud Scheduler is used to call the application on the aforementioned schedule.

-Ultimately, this Cloud Run microservice ensures that the software and associated APIs are up-to-date with the most latest, accurate and reliable ISO 3166-2 information for all countries/territories/subdivisions etc.

 Introduction
 ------------
 `iso3166-updates` is a software and accompanying API that consists of a series of scripts that check for any updates/changes to the ISO 3166 country codes and subdivision naming conventions, as per the ISO 3166 newsletter (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) and Online Browsing Platform (OBP) (https://www.iso.org/obp/ui).
 
-The ISO 3166 standard by the ISO (International Organization for Standardisation) defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, consolidated into the ISO 3166-1 standard [[1]](#references), and their principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces, states, departments, regions), which comprise the ISO 3166-2 standard [[2]](#references). The ISO 3166-1 was first published in 1974 and currently comprises 249 countries, 193 of which are sovereign states that are members of the United Nations ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [[1]](#references). The ISO 3166-2 was first published in 1998 and as of November 2023 there are 5,039 codes defined in it [[2]](#references).

The ISO 3166-1 was first published in 1974 and currently comprises 249 countries, 193 of which are sovereign states that are members of the United Nations ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ [[1]](#references). The ISO 3166-2 was first published in 1998 and as of November 2023 there are **5,039** codes defined in it [[2]](#references).
 
 ### Problem Statement:
 
-The ISO is a very dynamic organisation and regularly change/update/remove entries within its library of standards, including the ISO 3166. Additions/changes/deletions to country/territorial codes occur less often in the ISO 3166-1, but changes are more frequent for the ISO 3166-2 codes due to there being thousands more entries, thus it can be difficult to keep up with and track these changes. These changes can occur for a variety of geopolitical and administrative reasons. Previously these changes were communicated via newsletters; but as of July 2013 these changes are now communicated via their online catalogue/Online Browsing Platform (OBP), or via a database, which usually costs money to subscribe to (up to $300) [[3]](#references). Usually these updates are conveyed at the end of the year, with amendments and updates occasionally published at various times throughout the year [[4]](#references).

Usually these updates are conveyed at the end of the year, with amendments and updates occasionally published at various times throughout the year [[4]](#references). 
 
 This software and accompanying API make it extremely easy to check for any new or historic updates to a country or set of country's ISO 3166-2 codes for free; with an easy-to-use interface and Python package and API, ensuring that you get the most up-to-date and accurate ISO 3166-2 codes and naming conventions.
 
 ### Intended Audience:
 
 This software and accompanying API is for anyone working with country data at the ISO 3166 level. It's of high importance that the data you are working with is correct and up-to-date, especially with consistent changes being posted every year since 2000 (excluding 2001 and 2006). Also, it's aimed not just at developers of ISO 3166 applications but for anyone working in that space, hence the creation of an easy-to-use API (https://iso3166-updates.com).

+The main paths/endpoints available in the API are - `/api/all`, `/api/alpha`, `/api/name`, `/api/year` and `/api/months`. 
 
 * `/api/all`: get all of the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for all countries.
 
 * `/api/alpha`: get all the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for one or more countries according to their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, alpha-3 or numeric country codes. A single alpha code or a list of them can be passed to the API e.g. `/api/alpha/AL`, `/api/alpha/BW`, `/api/alpha/FR,DE,HUN,IDN,504`. If an invalid alpha code is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **year** and **month** endpoints to get the country updates for a specific country and year, and the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months, respectively. This will be in the format: `/api/alpha/<input_alpha>/year/<input_year>` and `/api/alpha/<input_alpha>/months/<input_month>`, respectively.
 
-* `/api/name`: get all the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for one or more countries according to their country name, as listed in the ISO 3166-1. A single country name or list of them can be passed into the API e.g. `/api/name/Brazil`, `/api/name/Colombia`, `/api/name/Benin,France,Moldova`. A closeness function is used to get the most approximate available country from the one input, e.g. Sweden will be used if the input is `/api/name/Swede`. If no matching country is found from the closeness function or an invalid name is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **year** and **months** endpoint to get the country updates for a specific country name and year and the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months, respectively. This will be in the format: `/api/name/<input_name>/year/<input_year>` and `/api/name/<input_name>/months/<input_month>`, respectively.

 * `/api/months`: get all the ISO 3166 updates/changes data for one or more countries from an input number of months from the present day, e.g. `/api/months/12`, `/api/months/24`, `/api/months/50`. A month range can also be input to get the updates published within a specified range of months, with the start and end month separated by a '-' e.g. `/api/months/12-24`, `/api/months/36-50`. If an invalid month value is input then an error will be returned. This endpoint can be used in conjunction with the **alpha** and **name** endpoints to get the country updates for a specific country over the past number of months using their ISO 3166-1 alpha code or country name, respectively.

 Staying up to date
 ------------------
 The list of ISO 3166 updates was last updated on <strong>March 2024</strong>.
 
-The object storing all updates - iso3166-updates.json - for the software package is consistently checked for the latest updates using a Google Cloud Run microservice ([iso3166-check-for-updates](https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates/tree/main/iso3166-check-for-updates)). The application is built using a custom Docker container that uses the `iso3166-updates` Python software to pull all the latest updates/changes from the various data sources, to check for the latest updates within a certain period e.g. the past 6-12 months (this month range is used as the ISO usually publishes their updates at the end of the year with occasional mid-year updates). The app compares the generated output with that of the updates JSON currently in the software package and will replace this json to integrate the latest updates found, such that the API will have the most up-to-date data. A Cloud Scheduler is used to call the application on the aforementioned schedule.

-Ultimately, this Cloud Run microservice ensures that the software and associated APIs are up-to-date with the most latest, accurate and reliable ISO 3166-2 information for all countries/territories/subdivisions etc.
