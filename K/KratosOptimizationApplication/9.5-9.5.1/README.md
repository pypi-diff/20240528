-# OptimizationApplication
-
-The Kratos OptimizationApplication is a framework for solving optimization problems in continuum mechanics. It is supposed to handle both gradient-based (adjoint-based) and gradient-free methods. 
-
-## Main Features
-
-* State-of-the-art techniques and algorithms for shape, thickness and material/topology optimization. 
-* Efficient and consistent filtering techniques for parametrization-free shape, thickness and material/topology optimization.       
-* Abstract problem formulation which enables concurrent and nested multilevel-multi-scale optimization problems.    
-* Adaptive gradient-projection technique, developed specially for problems with an arbitrary large number of design variables of different scales.
-* Modular implementation which enables analysis and optimization of multi-physics problems.    
-* Realization and implementation of additive manufacturing constraints, e.g. hangover conditions (support structures), stackability and geometric limitations.
