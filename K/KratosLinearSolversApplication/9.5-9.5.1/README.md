-
-The application provides the following direct solvers for dense systems of equations:
-
-| Python class                            | solver_type                            | Matrix requirements | Domain  | Dependencies |

-
-**Can also be used to solve equation systems with multiple right hand sides.
-
-## Generalized eigensystem solvers
-
-The application provides the following generalized eigensystem `Ax=λBx` solver for sparse matrices.
-
-| Python class                           | solver_type                | Matrix kind A | Matrix kind B | Domain   | Dependencies |
-|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:------------:|
-| EigensystemSolver                      | `eigen_eigensystem`        | Symmetric     | SPD*          | Real     | None         |
-| SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver             | `spectra_sym_g_eigs_shift` | Symmetric     | SPD*          | Real     | None         |
-| FEASTGeneralEigensystemSolver**        | `feast`                    | General       | General       | Real     | Intel® MKL   |
-| ComplexFEASTGeneralEigensystemSolver** | `feast_complex`            | General       | General       | Complex  | Intel® MKL   |
-
-*SPD = Symmetric Positive Definite
-**A special version for symmetric matrices can be triggered in the solver settings.
-
-`EigensystemSolver` and `SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver` compute the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the system. MKL routines are used automatically if they are available.
-
-`SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver` interfaces a solver from the [Spectra library](https://spectralib.org/), and has a shift mode that can be used to compute the smallest eigenvalues > `shift`.
-
-**Example:**
-
-```json
-{
-    "solver_type": "spectra_sym_g_eigs_shift",
-    "number_of_eigenvalues": 3,
-    "max_iteration": 1000,
-    "echo_level": 1
-}
-
-```
-If the application is compiled with MKL, [FEAST 4.0](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~polizzi/feast/) can be used to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for real and complex systems (symmetric or unsymmetric). The cmake switch `USE_EIGEN_FEAST` must be set to `ON` with
-```batch
--DUSE_EIGEN_FEAST=ON \
-```
-
-**Example:**
-```json
-{
-    "solver_type": "feast",
-    "symmetric": true,
-    "number_of_eigenvalues": 3,
-    "search_lowest_eigenvalues": true,
-    "e_min" : 0.0,
-    "e_max" : 0.2
-}
-```
-
-## Build instructions
-
-1. Set the required definitions for cmake
-
-    As any other app:
-
-    **Windows:** in `configure.bat`
-
-    ```batch
-    set KRATOS_APPLICATIONS=%KRATOS_APPLICATIONS%%KRATOS_APP_DIR%\LinearSolversApplication;
-    ```
-
-    **Linux:** in `configure.sh`
-
-    ```console
-    add_app ${KRATOS_APP_DIR}/LinearSolversApplication
-    ```
-
-2. Build Kratos
-
-3. Setup the `ProjectParameters.json`
-
-    ```json
-    "linear_solver_settings": {
-        "solver_type" : "LinearSolversApplication.sparse_lu"
-    }
-    ```
-
-4. Run the simulation
-
-## Enable MKL (optional)
-
-In case you have installed [MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) (see below), you can also use the Pardiso solvers.
-
-1. Run the MKL setup script before building Kratos:
-
-    **Windows:**
-
-    ```batch
-    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest\env\vars.bat" intel64 lp64
-    ```
-
-    **Linux:**
-
-    ```console
-    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64
-    ```
-

-
-Intel MKL can be installed with apt on Ubuntu. A guide can be found in [here](https://neelravi.com/post/intel-oneapi-install/).
-For example to install the MKL 2022 version
-
-```console
-sudo bash
-# <type your user password when prompted.  this will put you in a root shell>
-# If they are not installed, you can install using the following command:
-sudo apt update
-sudo apt -y install cmake pkg-config build-essential
-# use wget to fetch the Intel repository public key
-wget https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
-# add to your apt sources keyring so that archives signed with this key will be trusted.
-sudo apt-key add GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
-# remove the public key
-rm GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
-# Configure apt client to use Intel repository
-sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/oneapi all main"
-# Install all MKL related dependencies. You can install full HPC with: sudo apt install intel-hpckit
-sudo apt install intel-oneapi-mkl-devel
-# Exit
-exit
-```
-
-To enable the MKL environment (needs to be done before build/run) use

+
+| Python class             | solver_type            | Matrix kind | Domain   | Dependencies |
+|--------------------------|------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|

+
+*SPD = Symmetric Positive Definite
+
+**Can also be used to solve equation systems with multiple right hand sides.
+
+## Generalized eigensystem solvers
+
+The application provides the following generalized eigensystem `Ax=λBx` solver for sparse matrices.
+
+| Python class                           | solver_type                | Matrix kind A | Matrix kind B | Domain   | Dependencies |
+|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:------------:|
+| EigensystemSolver                      | `eigen_eigensystem`        | Symmetric     | SPD*          | Real     | None         |
+| SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver             | `spectra_sym_g_eigs_shift` | Symmetric     | SPD*          | Real     | None         |
+| FEASTGeneralEigensystemSolver**        | `feast`                    | General       | General       | Real     | Intel® MKL   |
+| ComplexFEASTGeneralEigensystemSolver** | `feast_complex`            | General       | General       | Complex  | Intel® MKL   |
+
+*SPD = Symmetric Positive Definite
+**A special version for symmetric matrices can be triggered in the solver settings.
+
+`EigensystemSolver` and `SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver` compute the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the system. MKL routines are used automatically if they are available.
+
+`SpectraSymGEigsShiftSolver` interfaces a solver from the [Spectra library](https://spectralib.org/), and has a shift mode that can be used to compute the smallest eigenvalues > `shift`.
+
+**Example:**
+
+```json
+{
+    "solver_type": "spectra_sym_g_eigs_shift",
+    "number_of_eigenvalues": 3,
+    "max_iteration": 1000,
+    "echo_level": 1
+}
+
+```
+If the application is compiled with MKL, [FEAST 4.0](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~polizzi/feast/) can be used to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for real and complex systems (symmetric or unsymmetric). The cmake switch `USE_EIGEN_FEAST` must be set to `ON` with
+```batch
+-DUSE_EIGEN_FEAST=ON \
+```
+
+**Example:**
+```json
+{
+    "solver_type": "feast",
+    "symmetric": true,
+    "number_of_eigenvalues": 3,
+    "search_lowest_eigenvalues": true,
+    "e_min" : 0.0,
+    "e_max" : 0.2
+}
+```
+
+## Build instructions
+
+1. Set the required definitions for cmake
+
+    As any other app:
+
+    **Windows:** in `configure.bat`
+
+    ```batch
+    set KRATOS_APPLICATIONS=%KRATOS_APPLICATIONS%%KRATOS_APP_DIR%\LinearSolversApplication;
+    ```
+
+    **Linux:** in `configure.sh`
+
+    ```console
+    add_app ${KRATOS_APP_DIR}/LinearSolversApplication
+    ```
+
+2. Build Kratos
+
+3. Setup the `ProjectParameters.json`
+
+    ```json
+    "linear_solver_settings": {
+        "solver_type" : "LinearSolversApplication.sparse_lu"
+    }
+    ```
+
+4. Run the simulation
+
+## Enable MKL (optional)
+
+In case you have installed [MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) (see below), you can also use the Pardiso solvers.
+
+1. Run the MKL setup script before building Kratos:
+
+    **Windows:**
+
+    ```batch
+    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest\env\vars.bat" intel64 lp64
+    ```
+
+    **Linux:**
+
+    ```console
+    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64
+    ```
+
+2. Add the following flag to CMake to your configure script:
+
+    **Windows:**
+
+    ```batch
+    -DUSE_EIGEN_MKL=ON ^
+    ```
+
+    **Linux:**
+
+    ```console
+    -DUSE_EIGEN_MKL=ON \
+    ```
+
+3. Build Kratos
+
+4. Usage:
+
+    **Windows:**
+
+    ```batch
+    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest\env\vars.bat" intel64 lp64
+    ```
+
+    **Linux:**
+
+    Set the environment before using MKL
+
+    ```console
+    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64
+    ```
+
+## Install MKL on Ubuntu with apt
